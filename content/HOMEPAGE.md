I'm a Berlin-based UX designer with a background in purchasing and customer service consulting. I’ve always focused on empathy and understanding of my customers’ needs, which has helped me to design user experiences that resonate with my users. I’m dedicated to creating designs that are user-centric, bridging the gap between what users expect and what the product can offer them.
